## SUBMISSION BY Stephen John Walentik

I Stephen Walentik have completed this Developer Code Test per the above scope.

## Running Part 1

I used Visual Studio code and to run python (v. 3.8.5 32-bit) to extract the data from the database and turn it into JSON for my program to disgest. 

To run this locally and have the outcome that I desired the file location for the database and the drop location for the json file need to be edited in the dbReader.py file. On line 191 the database location would need to be changed for the new local environment and then line 192 would need to be updated to reflect where the web app solution was downloaded to.

The dbReader.py file can be found in the code file directory once editing the 2 lines this program can be ran to read the database that was supplied and put the data file into the web app so the web app can run.

## Running Part 2

After running part 1 the data file should be updated in the project directory and ready to be used. Clicking and opening the solution into Visual Studios and running the project with IIS Express will bring up the web app.
